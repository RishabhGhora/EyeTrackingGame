# Eye Tracking System

## Simple Demo

```python
import cv2
from gaze_tracking import GazeTracking

gaze = GazeTracking()
webcam = cv2.VideoCapture(0)

while True:
    _, frame = webcam.read()
    gaze.refresh(frame)

    new_frame = gaze.annotated_frame()
    text = ""

    if gaze.is_right():
        text = "Looking right"
    elif gaze.is_left():
        text = "Looking left"
    elif gaze.is_center():
        text = "Looking center"

    cv2.putText(new_frame, text, (60, 60), cv2.FONT_HERSHEY_DUPLEX, 2, (255, 0, 0), 2)
    cv2.imshow("Demo", new_frame)

    if cv2.waitKey(1) == 27:
        break
```

## Documentation

In the following examples, `gaze` refers to an instance of the `GazeTracking` class.

### Refresh the frame

```python
gaze.refresh(frame)
```

Pass the frame to analyze (numpy.ndarray). If you want to work with a video stream, you need to put this instruction in a loop, like the example above.

### Position of the left pupil

```python
gaze.pupil_left_coords()
```

Returns the coordinates (x,y) of the left pupil.

### Position of the right pupil

```python
gaze.pupil_right_coords()
```

Returns the coordinates (x,y) of the right pupil.

### Looking to the left

```python
gaze.is_left()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking to the left.

### Looking to the right

```python
gaze.is_right()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking to the right.

### Looking at the center

```python
gaze.is_center()
```

Returns `True` if the user is looking at the center.

### Horizontal direction of the gaze

```python
ratio = gaze.horizontal_ratio()
```

Returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the horizontal direction of the gaze. The extreme right is 0.0, the center is 0.5 and the extreme left is 1.0.

### Vertical direction of the gaze

```python
ratio = gaze.vertical_ratio()
```

Returns a number between 0.0 and 1.0 that indicates the vertical direction of the gaze. The extreme top is 0.0, the center is 0.5 and the extreme bottom is 1.0.

### Blinking

```python
gaze.is_blinking()
```

Returns `True` if the user's eyes are closed.

### Webcam frame

```python
frame = gaze.annotated_frame()
```
