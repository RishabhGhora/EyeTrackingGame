## How to run

1. Install the dependencies in `requirements.txt`. Runs on Python 3.7+
2. Run the `spaceship_battle.py` file.

NOTE: to run on windows machines clone the 'windows' branch. The only difference is dealing with file paths for images differently.

## How to play

### Eye Gaze for Main Control

![](readme_assets/play_general.gif)
Use your eyes to move the ship around. The program tracks the coordinates of
your right eye and translates those coordinates to positions on the game screen,
where the spaceship (center, in white) will be pointed at.

Evil ships (in red) will continuously attack you until they are out of range
or until they die.
